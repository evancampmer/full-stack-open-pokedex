Linting helps enforce coding standards, detect potential issues, and make sure theres consistency across the team. In a Java application the best linting tools are Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs: Checkstyle looks for coding conventions and making sure the style is appropriate for a Java codebase, PMD is a static analyzer identifies dead code or code that needs refactoring, and SpotBugs checks for vulnerabilities. Testing tools include JUnit which is essential for unit tests, Selenium for integration tests over a user interaction with UI, and JaCoCo gives test coverge analysis to show how much of the code is being tested and covered. For Building aside from Jenkins and GitHub Actions there are Maven and Gradle: Maven is the most commonly used build tool for Java using XML configuration it is ideal for teams since it manages dependencies and handles the build cycle, Gradel is a modern build tool that can be faster than Maven due to its parallel execution. This setup would be best in a cloud-based environment due to the size of the team, the fact the application is already in deployment and the need for a scalable and speedy interface. It is also quite cost effective since GitHub Actions provide free tiers for their cloud-based environment. Also cloud-based environments are very collaborative and having a team of 6 would require a lot of ease in collaboration.
